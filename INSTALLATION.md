# IEEE Motor Vehicles Challenge (MVC) 2026 installation instructions

## Preparations
- Make a local clone of the GIT repository https://github.com/VTSociety/MVC_2026 or download the entire project.
- To facilitate operating with git, a helpful tool for Windows is e.g. [Tortoise GIT](https://tortoisegit.org/) but there are several other [Git GUI Clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) available. Please note that the use of Git is not mandatory.
- The simulation files were produced by using **MATLAB Version R2023b Update 10** (tested). If you use a different version, please check the compatibility of the Simulink model with the 2023b version. The final evaluation will be carried out with MATLAB R2023b. Furthermore, the following Toolboxes are required:
- Simscape (ver. 23.2)
  - Simscape Battery
  - Simscape Driveline
  - Simscape Electrical
- Optimization Toolbox (ver 23.2)
- Control System Toolbox

## Setup test
You can run tests with the "baseline EMS policy". To execute the Simulink model, please run the script "main.m":
- this script will define some parameters of the system;
- the mission profile will be selected according to the User's choice: 4 possibile driving cycles are available;

- it is possible to select whether the figures will be left open or closed after the simulation;
- it is possible to select whether the results are saved or not;
- at the end of the simulation, an autogenerated report will summarize the performance of the EMA;
Do not worry if the Simulink file does not show up: the script will run the simulation in the background. Alternatively, you can open the Simulink model and run it manually provided that the necessary parameters are set.

## Design the powertrain and battery pack

The participants will have to select both the motors size and the battery pack by making their own choices in the file "SystemDesign.m"

## Setup your own EMS

- Comment the "BaseEMS.m" line in the "main.m" and uncomment the "ProposedEMS.m" line. The "ProposedEMS.m" script will contain all the parameters of the proposal. See the [README](README.md) file for the rules of the competition.
- To run the Simulink model, save the model after the modification and run the main script "main.m" again.
- Evaluate your EMS by checking the generated "ResultsVTSChallenge2026.html".

Good luck... and keep it cool!
